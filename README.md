Welcome to Titan XIV
====================

You are a colonist aboard on the Interplanetary Transport System XIV, more commonly 
referred to as "Heart of Gold." Along with 199 other hopeful new citizens of Saturn's 
moon Titan, you expect to make first contact with the New World in just under 48 hours. 

Midway through the Heart of Gold's two-and-a-half year journey, the crew was informed
that the GSA (the Global Space Agency--a space program formed in the year 2094 to fund
the first colonist mission to Mars) had unexpectedly lost contact with the 2,500 
colonists that had been working to institute a new civilization on Saturn's largest 
moon for the past 250 years.

Little do you know that the Heart of Gold is destined for disaster, and few will 
survive its entry into the harsh atmosphere of the recently terraformed moon.
This catastrophe, however, is nothing compared to the hellscape you and the other
survivors are soon to discover on the desolate and dangerous surface below.
